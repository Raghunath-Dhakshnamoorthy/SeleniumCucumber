Sample Selenium-Cucmber Automation Framework:

Test Execution Instructions:
- I have developed the test scripts with Java, Selenium, Page Factory, JUnit, Cucumber(BDD) and used Maven(pom.xml) for handling dependencies.
- Please import the dependencies and you can run the script from TestRunner.java class or by using maven -clean -install
- Once the execution is completed, you can view the cucumber reports in output/cucumber-pretty/index.html
